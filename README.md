# OnePageSortVisualization
One page Sorting algorithm visualization using AngularJS, html and CSS
This is a personal project for me to better understand AngularJS, html, CSS and javascript and app development in general. The goal is to take in an input and 
have different buttons that would sort the values. These will sort them using different algorithms including BubbleSort, MergeSort, QuickSort and whatever I may add.
Once I have the sorting algorithms working, I am going to try to show how these algorithms work visually.
